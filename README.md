# BiEnchanted

💡Inspiration💡

BiEnchanted is our contribution to the fight against Bipolar Disorders and Schizophrenia, which is sweeping our country. It is a one-of-a-kind product that complements the range of solution-focused services we've developed. It's a collection of useful features aimed at assisting users in their recovery through various techniques. To do this, an app was created that includes feature tools for improving self-care. BiEnchanted bridges the gap between Users (patients) and Providers (Doctors, Coaches) by utilising a customised connect tool and incentivising users with rewards for daily meditation practises designed to improve accountability and provide users with the opportunity to monitor, track, and provide early intervention for the disrupted track. Working as a basic platform to handle bipolar disorders in a smooth manner.

❓What it does❓

Connect function- To connect with peers, doctors, and coaches so they can have accountability and community support when they need it. These features provide a variety of opportunities for further development and support. Mood Tracker- To keep track of their mood reactions on a daily basis so that they can recognise their mood swings trends. MedTrack tool- Users can work on their meditation on a daily basis with the built-in Awards section where users can claim rewards after checking in each day to boost the possibility of long-term use of Especial. Users earn and are told about mental benefits that they can obtain when thresholds are met, in order to keep them motivated to continue practising meditation. Interaction function- This is blogs site where all people without disorder can visit and understand about the hardships and difficulties the People with disorder are facing. Hence we implement the blog page so that people can know about the Do's and Dont's near the people with disorder to make thier lives simpler and peaceful.

🏗️How we built it🏗️

We Use HTML/CSS/JS for building the dashboard. We Use Twilio for Multi-factor Authentication and Connecting SMS from Coaches. We Use Google Calendar for MedTrack and Google Cloud for deployment. Matlab for testing out User patterns and track the patterns in Medtrack

🚧Challenges we ran into🚧

We had a hard time coming up with how to communicate with users without seeking or retaining their personal health information. Managing a team in different time zones was a challenge too.

🏅🏆ACCOMPLISHMENTS THAT WE ARE PROUD OF🏅🏆

We are delighted to have developed a solution for those suffering from these disorders and to have offered a unique user experience in which they can interact with doctors and coaches and seek help, as well as use a simple self-reporting daily mood check-in to notice and work on their mood patterns. In exchange for doing daily meditation, the User wins points and/or actual items and/or services.
